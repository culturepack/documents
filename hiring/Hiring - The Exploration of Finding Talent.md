## Hiring - the exploration of finding talent

This document acknowledges the fact that every company has their own approach. We attempt to call out some of them and it is our hope that others will contribute thereby making this a more complete compendium of best practices. 

The high-level  process is as follows 

![](https://github.com/culturepack/documents/img/hiring-high-level-process-v1.png "High-Level Hiring Process")

## The start

There needs to be defined entry to the process or it will delay the process significantly while also resulting in unpredictable results. I have seen this vary from nothing to a formal meeting with a clear definition of what needs to be completed.  


## Business Justification 

The step that no one wants to acknowledge exists or it is inserted at every step of the process. Like most things, the key is a middle of the road approach where the need for diligence is performed and the need to balanced against the fiscal capabilities, both current and future. 

I had people tell me that they’re part of a young and agile company and therefore they go with the flow. The don’t need this effort or they just chat with the founder they’re good to go. Heads up folks, the chat with a founder is an approval mechanism and it helps both the founder and the people who want to a headcount approved to know what the decision criteria is. And of course to determine that the funds are there, both short and long term. We’ve all seen a startup go on a massive hiring spree only to lay people off a year later. This is because they were not looking at the true costs. 

 At the opposite side of this, I’ve seen a person in a c-level want to approve a head count as it passed through each step of the process. Needless to say it took forever to hire someone and impacted morale because he refused to compensate people at the industry rates. 


### So why here and not later in the process?

Simple, having people go through a ton of work, only to have it killed later is not only a waste of people’s time but also impacts people's morale because a leader should understand the high-level flow instead of the drilling into the details .

The ideal business justification should cover the following:



*   Alignment with the strategic direction of the business
*   Why full time vs contractor?
*   Expected annual compensation range
*   Business justification - what's the business benefit (ROI) of the additional cost?
*   Role justification - why do we need this role vs another type of skills?


## Review and Approval 

This should be a formal sign off by authorized parties and these approvals should be retained and stored in case they are needed for legal or other audits.

Depending on the history and age of the company, I’ve seen these steps be extremely formal and long winded efforts to informal decision steps made based on the person's mood to non-existent.  


## Supporting Documentation

I’ve seen some crazy requirements for the documentation on this front and as such, I’m just going with the items that I believe the majority of companies are using. There might be additional ones specifically for your company, especially if they’ve been on the receiving side of litigation. 


### Role Description - Internal

This document describes the roles in such a manner that the employees understand what a role entails. They can then use these role definitions to understand a role and the skills needed. It provides the information needed to determine their skill gaps for a role and then to use this plan their career next steps. 


### Job Description - Internal 

Purpose - this is an internal document that is used by HR and legal to determine competitive compensation packages, performance standards of an individual and in the case of termination to determine the risk before terminating employment. Yes, this is a risk mitigation document and as such is always written in a manner that the employee can be terminated because they are not performing against the job description. 

Compensation alignment - there are a number of companies that provide services where companies can share job descriptions. These compensation reviews are performed using the job descriptions and key off the following items:

Industry, location, job title, role, responsibilities and requirements 


### Job Description - External 

The single purpose of this document is the get candidates to apply for the position and as such should not be written in a manner that caused applicant to self exclude! As such, I am big fan of gender neutral language being used for job descriptions. 

The biggest complaint i’ve encountered regarding this practice is from the recruiting department because they are concerned about workloads and as such make use of application automation to exclude candidate applications that do not meet the requirements. In my opinion, this practice has led to candidate behaviors that I find are unacceptable namely resume inflation and the excessive use of buzzwords.  


### Publishing Process

The external ob descriptions should be published externally in order to attract candidates. 


### Recruiting

This is subject worth it’s own section and in particular the interview process and methodology. As such interviewing is covered separately in it’s own documentation collection. 

Often this is the first close encounter that candidates will have with a company and as such how well it flows will set the tone of the rest of the engagement. This often reminds me of the research on initial impressions that people make snap judgements on people based on their initial interaction often less than a second. So what assessment do you want candidates to have of your company? Do you want to leave this to chance? 


### Candidate Experience 

Candidates are interviewing the company too and as such we need to put our best foot forward while also being realistic and making sure they have the understanding of what it will be like to be working in our company. So, we need to look at the experience from the candidate's perspective and ask ourselves how we would view the company when the following happens:



*   Qualified candidates receive a follow-up email after they have applied and the recruiter is forwarding the resume to a hiring manager for review.
*   Candidates are kept abreast of the flow through the process
*   It takes weeks in between each step where nothing is heard
*   Companies ignore all candidate communications 
*   Companies offer compensation and/or benefit packages that are not aligned with the competitors 
*   Multiple interviewers ask the same questions

## Process and Methodology Retrospectives

 \
At least twice a year, a retrospective will be scheduled in order to collect actionable feedback regarding the process and associated documentation, the methodology used. It is important to capture all the feedback, both employee and candidate, and some metrics as listed below.

If there are no changes or actions that come out of these retrospectives, you just need to be honest with yourself that the whole review process is a sham because no matter the feedback, if changes are not made or take too long.

Process Flow \
There are two workflows, a generic and a team specific workflow. The generic workflow is where we will have common positions listed as open on our website and we will route the candidates and have the team selection based on the candidate's skills and career aspirations. Then there is the team specific flow where the team drives the business justification for additional headcount, the prioritization with the rest of the company and then the recruitment process flow. \
This process defines the steps that need to be completed at a high level. No team “owns” a set number of headcount. Headcount is assigned by the Company per the recruitment process flow. \
Team Need - Team Lead/Director \
The team believes that they are understaffed and need additional headcount. They document their need and provide the standard job title on this page: https://istreamplanet.atlassian.net/wiki/x/2YA0Iw Add the request to the bottom of the suggested headcount section. \
 \
Get headcount - Team Lead/Director raise the need for the headcount to your executive and they will raise this at the next Leadership team sync for a decision on allocation. For those that are critical and can't wait for the next meeting, after an exec is made aware of the request, that exec will reach out to the group (slack or email) with the details of the headcount request. Approval from all is needed and can be obtained through this avenue. This should be an exception to the process, not the rule. Approval to proceed will be given at this meeting or . We need a way to have written approval. \
 \
Job Descriptions (JD) - Team Lead/Director \
Two JDs need to be written (or repurposed from the library of existing JDs) for each open req: \
 \
The first JD is used by HR Compensation to research comparable compensation packages. This needs to contain industry = software engineering, all the requirements and skills we are looking for. This is a brief and concise document that is meant for internal use only. If you are getting compensation results that are not in alignment with the industry, it is because you’re missing something in your JD - key items in the JD that compensation use are: industry, title, role responsibilities, requirements, experience, education - the more detailed this document is the better results you will get from compensation because they use these to perform the lookups in the compensation tooling. \
 \
The second JD is for public release to attract attention from prospective candidates. This means it must contain only the absolute must-have requirements (should not be a laundry list) and should be polished for public consumption. The use of gender-neutral language is mandatory. \
 \
All non-standard titles, and any JD changes, must be reviewed and approved by HR and the Leadership team prior to posting the req. \
 \
Get comparable compensation (2 days to 3 weeks) - HR \
Using the HR template, get comparable compensation from HR. HR can choose to use existing data for common titles however in the case of non-standard titles it can take up to 3 weeks to complete this effort. \
 \
Publish public JD - Recruiting \
Recruiting will get the public JD published.There are times when #4 and #5 could be done hand-in-hand versus #5 relying on #4. Check with HR. A Hiring Manager or point of contact (POC) must be identified for each position before the position is posted. \
 \
Incoming Applicants - Recruiting \
All applicants need to submit applications via the tooling (i.e. apply online through the posting or Careers website). This is the only acceptable mechanism. All applicants will receive an acknowledgement that their application was received. For referrals, the applicant will still need to apply online, but the referring employee should send an email to both the Recruiter and HR that includes the applicant’s resume, contact information, and position being referred to. It is the recruiters responsibility to track all referrals and ensure status is visible by key stakeholders. \
 \
Recruiting screening - Recruiting \
Recruiting will screen every applicant and provide them actionable feedback, be it preparation for a phone screen or reasons why we will not be moving forward. If the recruiter receives no instructions from the Hiring manager, no additional screening will be performed. \
 \
Initial screening - Hiring Manager or Screening Team Member   \
Applications believed to meet the criteria are sent to the Hiring Manager or the on-call screening team member for review and designation of “Schedule Interview” or “Pass.” Reviewing applications and decisions made should be completed with two days of receiving (pending PTO and other deliverables, to which a proxy must be identified and communicated to Recruiting in advance). All referred applicants will receive a call from the Recruiter to discuss their experience, whether or not they meet the criteria of the role. Recruiting is responsible for following up with the referring employee on decision/status. \
 \
Exercise - Recruiting and Candidate \
Ideally, we will have a role-specific exercise for each candidate to perform to get their phone screen scheduled. This exercise should be created by the role-specific core skills panel and reviewed with the candidate during the phone screen. \
 \
Phone Screen - Hiring Manager or designated generic phone team member \
Each hiring manager will perform a phone screen and should cover the following areas:  \
Feedback on the exercise \
Culture and work environment discussion \
Their goals and ensure synergy \
 \
At the end of the call, feedback will be provided to the candidate as to why we are not moving forward or that we will be moving forward with an on-site face-to-face loop. \
 \
Hiring Manager or phone screen team member is responsible for entering their feedback into the tool within twenty-four hours. Recruiting is responsible for following up with the referring employee on decision/status. \
 \
Face-to-face loop scheduling \
The Interview scheduler will schedule the face-to-face loop within a week unless specifically asked to delay by the candidate or excessive travel costs. The coordinator needs to collaborate with the team members of the four quadrants and ensure that the times work. \
 \
For candidates that are all looping for the same position, it is ideal to have the same people on the loop. The candidate will have the agenda and everyone on the agenda will need to complete their interview as scheduled. \
 \
The face-to-face loop will entail a whole day and as such we should encourage candidates to be well rested. \
 \
Pre-brief \
Should be at least an email that has the times and who the candidate is seeing. Clear ownership of which quadrant each interviewer is responsible for needs to be called out because we may have interviewers that can interview for multiple quadrants. \
 \
Face-to-face Loop - Hiring Loop \
There will be a role-specific face-to-face loop. \
 \
All interviewers are required to capture their decision and feedback in the tool within twenty-four hours. \
 \
Transitions between the interviewers should highlight areas that require follow-up from interviewers later in the cycle. Interviewers should never share their opinions regarding the candidate. The interview must be completed as scheduled. \
 \
Debrief - Hiring Loop, Hiring Manager, and Recruiting \
Within one business day, we need to complete a debrief to make a decision on whether to move forward or not. This meeting is run by the recruiter. Whoever welcomed the candidate into our office, as well as the coordinator who scheduled the loop need to provide feedback in the tool and attend the debrief. \
 \
All interviewers attending the debrief should familiarize themselves with the feedback provided in the tool prior to the debrief. Everyone gets to ask clarifying questions to their fellow interviewer feedback before finalizing the decision. Should there be a tie, the person responsible for the Company quadrant makes the final decision.   \
 \
Communicate back to candidate - Recruiter \
The decision needs to be communicated back to the candidate within one business day. If the decision is not to move forward, we do need to provide candidates with actionable feedback so that their investment is rewarded. Recruiting is responsible for following up with the referring employee on decision/status. \
 \
Compensation will always be presented as an annual package. \
 \
Closing \
Recruiting should own the closing, but, if needed, the Company quadrant interview or one of the executive team will engage with the candidate in order to help close. An offer should expire within 3-5 business days and, unless critical, no extensions should be made. If a candidate cannot decide if they want to work for iSP within the standard offer deadline, then the Company should be prepared to walk away from the candidate. \
Retrospective \
In order to determine how we have improved the situation and how successful this approach is, we will be evaluation this effort in the following manner. \
Returning Candidates \
We need to track candidates that we passed on and shared actionable feedback that returned after closing the gap identified in the actionable feedback. \
New Hire input \
All new hires will be asked the following questions by HR on their 6 month, 1 year and 18 month anniversaries: Knowing what you know now, would you accept our offer? Why? (Actionable feedback so that we can fix) \
New Hire Progress \
The managers of all new hires will be asked the following questions by HR on the 6 month, 1 year, and 18 month anniversaries: Knowing what you know now, would you accept our offer? Why? (Actionable feedback so that we can fix) \
Twice a year, managers of all new hires will be asked the following questions by HR: Knowing what you know now, would you accept our offer? Why? (Actionable feedback so that we can fix) \
HR and the Leadership team will review the new hire feedback together with the manager feedback and then work with the hiring managers, interview teams, and recruiting to improve our hiring process and methodology. \
Process and Methodology Retrospectives \
At least twice a year, a retrospective will be scheduled by HR/Leadership in order to collect actionable feedback regarding this document, the process and methodology which will result in changes as needed. \
