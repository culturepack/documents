## Interview Methodology

There are many variations on interview methodologies, some of them are public and others are fiercely protected because companies it is one of their differentiators. I see merits to both of these approaches. The approach that I believe is just gross negligence is for a large and established company not to have a structure at all. The good news is that this is always an indicator of a company that doesn't care about their employees. 

## Why have a structured interview methodology?

Time, efficiency, consistency 

## Team of trained interviewers

Interviewing is a complicated problem and as such a simple solution does not exist. The candidate is interviewing the interviewers. The interviewers are evaluating the candidate. All candidates need to have a consistent experience. Candidates often have competing offers from other companies and so moving through the process quickly is a necessity. Depending on the maturity of the company, there may be very specific legal and audit deliverables. As such, it can result in a perfect storm and in most cases it does; where a simple structure will quickly ensure that your company’s interview loop will differentiate you from others.

Therefore with all of this in play, it is critical that everyone involved in the loop knows their roles and what is expected of them. In most cases, organizations either ignore this or attempt to achieve it in an ad hoc manner by having a preparation meeting. I’m suggesting that this is a role just like any other one and a role that requires skills. Having a team of people that can deliver a predictable and consistent result means that all candidates get to experience a consistent and ideally ‘enjoyable’  experience while also ensuring that no single person is overwhelmed with an enormous workload. 

The first area of training that is required, is some form of training that covers what questions need to be avoided. There are very specific Federal, State laws that cover what cannot be asked. Even CEO’s can ask the most inappropriate questions during loops and as such this training must reviewed annually and any interviewers who are unable to avoid these types of questions should lose their right to interview because of the risk they pose to the company! 

Here are some of  the areas to be avoided.

*   Age related - e.g. when did you graduate?
*   Gender 
*   Immigration state
*   Health or disability 
*   Drug or alcohol related 
*   Relationship status
*   Information that be specific to competitors or be covered by NDA’s
*   Company specific areas as defined by company policy and procedures 

While a number of these areas need to be covered to determine if the candidate can be legally employed, it is best to leave these areas to the recruiting professional. If a candidate brings them up, simply refer them to the recruiter. Do not discuss these areas. 

## Core Skills 
In this section each candidate will have a role-specific portion of the loop. We will require a Team of Interviewers for each set of skills. All roles, as applicable, should be assessed for a candidate’s ability to have a clear, technical conversation, as well as their ability to articulate, verbally and written, technical requirements. 

## SDE Skills 
Each candidate will be required to perform a paired programming exercise. 
 
## Interviewers should be able to: 
* Demonstrate empathy for a candidate placed in a stressful situation marked by an imbalance of power 
* “Sell” working at the company, describe the mission and culture (the interview process is a two-way street) 
* Engage with candidate and answer questions to drive progress in a stalled interview
* Steer the interview towards obtaining a solution, while evaluating related software design skills 
* Read and reason about code in multiple languages 
* Analyze complexity (big-O) 
* Understand trade-offs of different design patterns and architectures 
* Tailor the exercise to the experience of the candidate 
* Listen and hear different personalities (not everyone is comfortable ‘thinking out loud’) 
* Conduct different types of interviews (e.g. algorithm implementation, system architecture) 
* Focus on problem solving and general software design skills, not trivia knowledge 

## Candidates should demonstrate knowledge, experience, and skill in areas relevant to our software development process: 
* Willingness to learn new languages/tools/systems/processes 
* Requirement Analysis 
* Dealing with ambiguity 
* Prioritization 
* Critical thinking 
* Work estimation 
* Bigger picture awareness 
* Software Design 
* General problem solving 
* Algorithms 
* Data storage 
* Trade-off analysis 
* Networking 
* Cloud patterns/distributed systems 
* Software Development 
* Implementation 
* Debugging 
* Testing (Unit/Functional/End-to-end) 
* Code review 
* Performance 
* Logging/monitoring practices 
* Operations 
* Deployment 
* Analytics 
* Live troubleshooting 
* SRE, Infrastructure, and Networking Skills 

Each candidate should demonstrate knowledge and experience the following areas through explaining their prior activities in these areas in combination with scenario based questions. The goal is to understand the breadth and depth of knowledge in these areas to assess their ability to work in a cross-functional team.

* Building distributed systems and services - both software and infrastructure 
* Building and maintaining cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, etc.) 
* Configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, etc.) 
* Infrastructure management tools (Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.) 
* Monitoring tools and infrastructure (DataDog, Circonus, CloudWatch, etc.) 
* Building and Maintaining networks at some level of scale (Network Engineers specifically) 
* Linux system administration 

Understanding how a candidate approaches problem solving is a critical. We are looking for data driven and fact based decision making. When there is an unknown, the candidate should be able to articulate an approach to measure the impact of the problem and the improvement achieved. 

Each candidate should discuss monitoring and how they have approached it. They should be touching on things being actionable and avoiding alert fatigue.

### SRE
* Each SRE candidate will be required to perform a troubleshooting exercise as well as a paired programming exercise that either creates a program or a script. These exercises should be based on prior or current iStreamPlanet situations.
* SRE candidates should give details of how they have automated a traditionally manual process.
 

## Product Owner Skills 
Feature prioritization based on customer input: 
* Each candidate needs to provide examples of how they prioritize and decide on what needs to be built based on customer interactions. We are operating on the assumption that recent performance on their recent iterations is an indicator of future performance. 
* Understanding how the candidate leverages data collection in order to make fact-driven decisions. How do the candidates collect customer feedback, in both quantitative and qualitative metrics and manners. 
* Understanding how the candidate collaborates with other product owners to ensure plans across teams are taken into account. \
(Possible Questions) 
* How do you decide what to build? 
* How best do you interact with customers/users. 
* What have you done in the past 5 sprints, to increase the chances of delivering a high-value product? 
* How do you know if your product is successful and delivers high value? 
* What have you done lately to increase the value of the Development Team? 
* What features should be removed from the product? How do you know they should be removed? How can you tell that you can't remove a feature? 
* Describe a time you have worked with multiple teams to deliver your product 
* Describe a time where you had a difficult customer/user. How did you work through the differences? Were you successful? What did you learn from this experience? 
* How do you identify and address scope-creep? Do you feel comfortable pushing back on a customer/user? Describe a situation where you did and its outcome. 
* Project Management/Program Manager Skills 
* Drive projects and programs in an agile and collaborative manner 
* Each candidate should be able to provide examples of how they can drive projects and programs in a hybrid methodology and influence teams without the line managementauthority in constructive ways 
* They need to have an understanding about schedules, roadmaps, risks and dependencies but be able to translate that into sprints, stories, tasks when needed for teams. 
* They need to have an understanding of measuring projects and programs based on fact drive decisions and more than just is it on time and on budget. 
* The candidate should provide examples of how they helped the team with blockers and how the team succeeded. 

### (Possible Questions)
* How do you measure your project/program success? 
* How do you influence teams without authority? 
* How do you meld together traditional view of PM and agile views of project management? 
* What was the last project that failed and why? 
* What project are you most proud of and why? 
* In your own words, define a project’s success. 
* How do you handle multiple projects with conflicting priorities? Describe a time in which you had to do so. What were the give and takes you had to make, and were you successful? 

## Customer Success Skills 
* Customer Success Engineer 
* Candidates should have Enterprise level experience in senior engineering yet customer facing role. Their skill set and experience should include: 
* Customer empathy 
* Excellent written and communication skills with the ability to convey complex technical issues to all audiences (sample provided during the interview loop) 
* Ability to troubleshoot full application stacks (OS to customer applications) 
* Strong knowledge of and troubleshooting experience in network layers, hardware and administration 
* Knowledge of at least one software language with the proven ability to work in an Agile-development cycle with consistent, predictable output 
* The ability to provide solutions within popular stacks, frameworks, and technology

#### Questions/Scenarios: 
* Give an example of the last mistake you made. What did you learn and what did you do to prevent yourself and others from making that mistake again? 
* Tell me about a problem that you have recently solved with automation/scripting; How did you solve it and tell me about any challenges that you  experienced in creating that automation/scripting. 
* What recent solution are you most proud of implementing and why? 
* Describe continuous improvement and how to use it to remove failure modes. 
* How do you handle an upset customer?

* Customer Engagement Loop 

#### Each candidate needs to be evaluated on the following specific skills: 
*(Work in progress)*

## People Leader 
The short version is that we need People Leaders who understand this is a thankless role in which employee needs will always be put ahead of their personal needs. While traditional authoritative management techniques deliver results in the short term, they do not result in long-term sustainable structures. In addition, we need people who understand how to balance basic human rights and decency while also being able to meet aggressive business goals. 

* Ability to handle standard manager responsibilities such reviews, 1:1’s and other coaching tasks. Behavior modification skills are critical with the ability to have crucial conversations with empathy, focus, safety and clarity. Ability to understand that no one is perfect, leveraging coaching or disciplinary action when warranted to address behaviors or actions. 
* Not afraid of conflict. 

### Behavior 
This quadrant is often underrated in priority and considering that we are looking for strong teams, we need to be as diligent here as we are on core skills. So, some of the core competencies that need to be covered are: 

### Teamwork 
We are looking for people that are capable of operating as part of a team. 

### Self Awareness 
We need candidates to be able to aware of what is going on around them and modify their behaviors accordingly. We need people that are aware of the impact of their behaviors on others as well the implications of technical approaches on the business. 

### Communication 
We work with colleagues and customers and as such we need to communicate with them. We need to evaluate candidates ability to communicate in the following areas: active listening, clarity, conciseness, both spoken and nonverbal, friendliness, and respect. 

### Conflict Management 
Healthy conflict resolution is critical to a healthy culture. As such, we need every employee to understand that conflict avoidance is as damaging as combative behavior. 

### Influence 
This often underrated behavior is required horizontally with peers, both known and unknown, downward to customers where less data may be provided because there is less context, and upward to our board. We need to understand the candidate’s awareness of informal and formal structured influence and how to leverage which approach for different situations. 

### Accountability 
Ensure that every candidate is able to account for actions and decisions, demonstrate that that accepted responsibility for them, and to disclose the results in a transparent manner. This is important when things did have the desired result and also ensuring that others received the reward and recognition for their efforts. 
 
### Mindset 
This quadrant covers key mindset that will enable our company to continue to grow and accelerate our efforts to meet our customer needs. 

### Fixed vs Learning 
People with a learning mindset believe that their knowledge grows over time and with experience. As knowledge is the first step of the growth journey, we are looking for people who are capable of continuous learning and skills growth. 

### Bias for Action 
We are looking for people whose default stance is to take action to improve the situation. As we are all aware, movement for the sake of movement is undesirable; yet decision-making should not lead to paralysis. Therefore, the Interviewer must also determine if the candidate evaluates risk in an expedient manner. 

### Dealing with Ambiguity 
People like certainty and clarity. However, we do not live in a polar world. We are looking for candidates that can help us bring clarity to our competitive landscape. \

### Inclusive 
This can also be called open-mindedness or mindfulness. We are looking for candidates that are open to the ideas of others and are able to communicate effectively in order to achieve alignment and commit. 

### Disagree and Commit 
This is a philosophy from Intel’s Andy Grove and it is simple. It is the ability to  disagree in a respectful manner while the decision in being made but once a decision has been made to commit to it. 


## Frequently Asked Questions

Q - Reading through this document, it is becoming apparent that we have not structured our roles yet and as such we can’t follow an approach like this. Is this a cop out?

No, being aware of your current state is admirable. The key is to continually make improvements and so leverage what you can of this approach while investing elsewhere as needed. Just revist on a regular basis and improve.
