## ready to “manage” people……

When I was asked to take on my first team leadership position in a professional capacity, I knew enough to know that I was definitely not ready. The great news is that my direct manager and my mentor both knew this too and had a discussion together with me.I’ll never forget the discussion and it went the lines of:

We think you should apply for the team lead position for the following reasons:



*   You have a sense of urgency and always want to solve customer issues, in an infectious manner - people wanna follow your lead and be part of it
*   Sometimes you listen to people and other times not so much…..we will need to work on making this behavior consistent 
*   You are intolerant of people not delivering what they committed to or being lazy and call them on it - 
*   We need to work on a new skills coaching, it is different from the mentor role that you’ve already been performing 

Wow, talk about Radical Candor, they were pretty clear with what I had to work first while also committing to help me. Thinking back on this discussion, at no stage did I think they were doing this for them, Even though this role would be the only technical leader in the company and as such was a critical role. I didnt think about the risk they were taking in giving a young cocky kid the opportunity to perform in this critical role… The discussion was about me and what it would take in order to succeed in the role!

Roll on more than two decades and I myself have had to have many of these discussions myself and I like to think that I learned from my professors who showed me how to do it right in the beginning of me people leadership efforts. Here are some of the lessons I’ve learned as a people leader.


## Lessons Learned



1. It’s never about you! The moment you make it about you, people know this, either consciously or unconsciously and now you have an agenda that 
2. Set expectations ahead of time so that people understand where the bar is - as people work to achieve something, praise them and then raise the bar. Humans thrive on challenges. 
3. There is a massive difference between telling people what to do and leading them - in order to lead, you need to get their permission and buy-in otherwise, you're just another person telling them what to do 
4. Everything is situational and so just because people are following your lead in one situation, it doesn't sound that they will follow your lead in other situations
5. Communication, communication, communication, it never stops and just because you’re tired of communicating something, refer to rule # 1. This means having tough conversations, discussions about behaviors, performance etc.
6. Help people grow their skills. If you’re not helping, you’re judging and sitting on the outside. Remember the rules above. 
7. People know when they’re not performing and meeting expectations - imposter syndrome is a very real issue in the USA where this is extremely common - it takes a combination of the rules above to address this situation - 


## So, are you ready to lead people?
