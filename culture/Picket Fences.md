## Picket Fences

This document is a collection of behaviors and guidelines that have worked for the teams in the past and are being used to help newcomers understand our culture (although we all need reminders occasionally). Therefore, the team commit to review, reflect and retrospective this document on a quarterly basis. This ensures that this is a continually evolving document.

When I moved to the USA from South Africa, I met with a representative from a well known Southern company and he shared the following with me, well at least this is my recollection.

He started off by sharing some photos of Lexington, his hometown. He showed the green grass, the beautiful horse properties, the picket fences and then he shared the following about the picket fences:


*   Allow the kids to easily climb over them
*   They are very visible and mark the borders clearly
*   They can be moved should the property lines need to be moved
*   If your dog drops their load on the wrong side, you know to clean it up
*   In order for the fences remain becaustiful, they do need to be maintained on regular basis

So, the guidelines lines listed are not rules that need to followed exactly. The principles listed here are simply guidelines and need to embraced by all in order to be effective.

### Delight _Our_ Customer

**Our** highest priority is to satisfy _our_ customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable functionality, service availability and support that incorporates their feedback. It is Our customer and not ‘the’ customer because we’re referring to a relationship between us and our customer.


### Solutions Only 

Always endeavor to provide a solution to a customer issue without creating additional issues. If you don't know how to solve the issue, just say so and ask for help.

If you’re bitchin you're part of the problem or to put this slightly differently, misery loves company. Therefore when people get together and complain they are focused on the negative and not on how to solve the issue. Let's take those emotions and channel them towards making a difference, towards making the situation better. 


### Sense of Urgency

Approach everything with a sense of urgency and we deliver working functionality to our customers frequently (time-to-market). Remember that urgency is not a replacement for proactive actions; the two are brothers in arms.


### Proactive actions

The best outage is the one that you never have! It takes proactive actions to bring clarity to unknown, unscoped or ambiguous areas. The well known proverb says it all:  _"the road to Hell is paved with good intentions"_


### Communication

HOTIR Communication is the only communication that works. HOTIR = Honest, Open, Two-way, Inclusive, and Respectful. We don’t like it when others exclude us, hide information from us, lie to us or treat us in a manner that is demeaning; so let’s not do it to others.

Different perspectives are valued as long as they are shared in an open, honest and respectful manner. We endeavor not to be offensive, while also committing not to take offense. Oh, yes, keep up with your slack,

Not telling the truth or being unwilling to address topics that should be discussed, should be treated as gross negligence. 


### No Small People

We will treat everyone as we want to be treated and no one is better than anyone else. A higher skill level in a certain area or a fancy title,does not make someone a better person requiring different treatment. This means that we all operate in a similar manner, including executives. The implications of this that everyone is treated the same - no fancy offices, no separate expense or travel policies.


### Wisdom of not doing

Not every problem needs to be addressed. By “choosing our battles” we can focus our energies on more important issues.


### Making Decisions Matters

Not making a decision on something is simply allowing someone else to make the decision for us.


### Safety

In our organization it is safe to share ideas, make mistakes and learn from them. We share ideas and problems alike. We don’t judge.


### Ego is not your amigo

Do not let ego drive your actions or decisions


### Empowered Accountable Ownership and Leadership

We hold ourselves and our colleagues accountable to do the right thing and we own our tasks. There is no shared ownership. The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. As such, we all agree to step up to the situation and lead should the situation require our skillset. Someone from our team will always lead should the situation require it. Everyone needs to be prepared and willing to step in and lead if they're the best person to do so, and two, if a leader is needed for a circumstance that affects this team/org, then the presumption is someone from this team will lead.


### Awareness

Change is constant and so we must be diligent in our validation efforts to ensure that our perspective is as accurate as possible. At regular intervals, our team reflects on how we view the world, what is working and what's not working, and what needs to change in order to adapt to the situation. The team then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.


### Have Courage

Have courage to innovate and improve everything that we do while mitigating risk as much as possible. FAIL fast (First Attempt In Learning)


### Unique Mistakes

Making mistakes is part of learning; learning from other people’s mistakes is wisdom, while repeating the same mistakes is a waste of time and effort.


### Continuous Learning | Improvement | Reflection

Learning from feedback and acting on the lessons learned. See retrospective.


### Discipline

We do right without being asked to do the right thing.


### In or Out

If we’re in, we commit 100% and focus on the task on hand. We support our teammates when they need help.


### Disagree and Commit

The principle essentially mandates that everyone show up prepared to speak their mind freely, even if it means heated discussion. Your obligation is to agree or disagree and to speak openly about your position. The conflict, tension and debate is healthy as long as people focus on attacking the ideas and issues, and not one another.

At the end of the meeting, however, everyone commits to the decisions made, regardless of whether they agree or disagree.


### Cattle not Pets

We don’t build or maintain Pets.


### Fact-driven

We gather and use data to drive a decision. We do not use data to rationalize a perspective! If no data exists, make an educated guess. If we don’t know, we ask for help. If we’re really stuck, we do a retrospective. We measure to improve.  We measure everything we can, as often as we can. We use the data and then blend this with our wisdom and experiences in order to drive to fact-based decisions. 


### Role Clarity

Everyone must know what their role in each situation is and how their efforts contribute to the company’s goals. Leadership is welcomed, management less so because we don't need others to think for us.


### Technology

We are passionate about technology but not married to a particular one. We are open to technology adoption and industry alignment and understand that this adoption cost will need to be aligned with business priorities that may or may not impact our ability to adopt. 


### Everything is code

Infrastructure and configurations are code, and should be developed and managed as such.


### Automation

Automation is key and is a driving force.
